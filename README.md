# ioScheduler_OS
This lab implements the scheduling and optimization of I/O operations. 
The scheduler selects a request from the I/O queue and then submits to the disk device. 

Assume that moving the head by one costs one time unit, and the disk only processes one request at a time. 

The scheduler implementes the following algorithms:
1) FIFO (first in first out)
2) SSTF (shortest seek time first)
3) LOOK 
4) CLOOK 
5) FLOOK
