# ioScheduler_OS
This lab implements the scheduling and optimization of I/O operations. The scheduler selects a request from the I/O queue and then submits to the disk device. Assume that moving the head by one costs one time unit. The disk only processes one request at a time. The schedulers that need to be implemented are FIFO (i), SSTF (j), LOOK (s), CLOOK (c), and FLOOK.
